# Hi, I'm Pedro Henrique G. Abreu ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Currently in the 4th semester of **Information Systems** at the **Federal University of Santa Maria**, I'm passionate about technology, software development and innovative solutions. I have experience in languages â€‹â€‹such as C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS, as well as an interest in artificial intelligence, algorithms and game development.

I'm always looking for challenges that expand my knowledge and allow me to create efficient and impactful solutions.
